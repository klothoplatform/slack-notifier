# Klotho slack-notifier bot

A GitHub â†’ Slack notification bot that emphasizes a signal-to-noise ratio. Our bot posts pull request notifications in a thread (one thread per pull request) to keep the chatter down and let you actually keep track of what's going on.

![a single message for a pull request, with updates in the message thread](docs/images/slackbot-thread.png)

To get up and running quickly, see our [installation tutorial][tutorial].
